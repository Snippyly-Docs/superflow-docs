## How to Change Status

In this article, you will learn how to change the comment's status. There are three (3) types of statuses including (a) Open, (b) In Progress, and (c) Resolved. It is worth noting that there are a couple of ways to change the comment status either by creating a new comment or updating the status of a current comment. In this example, we will use the latter.

1. On the screen, find and click the **Comment** that you want to update.

Alternatively, you can mark the comment resolved by clicking the ***Check Mark** on the upper right side of the **Comment Box**.
