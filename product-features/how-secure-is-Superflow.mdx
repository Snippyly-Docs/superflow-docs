## How Secure is Superflow

Superflow aims to be the most secure annotation and collaboration tool. To do this, we are in the process of becoming SOC II compliant.

SOC II is Service Organization Control Type 2 which is a cybersecurity compliance framework developed by the American Institue of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). The primary purpose of SOC II is to ensure that third-party service providers store and process client data securely.
