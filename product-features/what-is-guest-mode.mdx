## What is Guest Mode?

Guest mode is a Superflow feature that allows guests to comment on projects without having to sign in to a Superflow account. It is important to note, that this feature needs to be enabled before a non-Superflow user can comment on a project.

See [How to use Guest Mode](https://docs.usesuperflow.com/how-to-guides/how-to-use-guest-mode) for more information.
