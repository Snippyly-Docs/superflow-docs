# Superflow Product Updates - Feb 22, 2024

We are excited to announce new features in the Superflow platform, enhancing the ease of integration and expanding the ways you can provide feedback. Here's what's new:

## Install with Google Tag Manager (GTM)

Users familiar with Google Tag Manager (GTM) for installing tools like Google Analytics can now effortlessly integrate Superflow using the same GTM.
Superflow's onboarding process will automatically detect if a GTM script exists on your website. If a GTM is found, you'll be offered the option to install Superflow through it, eliminating the need to manually embed Superflow's code snippet into your site's HTML.


## Screen Recording Feature (Desktop)

Superflow now allows you to record your desktop screen directly within the platform, making it easier to provide visual feedback. Beyond simple recording, Superflow utilizes AI to transcribe and summarize the contents of your screen recordings. Superflow's built in screen recording feature means you no longer need external recording tools like Loom, streamlining your workflow.

## Voice Recording Feature (Mobile)

Recognizing how clients often need to leave the feedback while on-the-go, Superflow introduces voice recording for mobile users. This feature enables clients to leave voice notes easily while reviewing websites on their mobile device, enhancing the flexibility of feedback.
