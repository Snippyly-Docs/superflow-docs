# Superflow Product Updates - Feb 29, 2024

We're excited to announce the latest updates to Superflow! Here's what's new in this release:


## Option to Collaborate on Files (Beta)
Superflow has expanded its collaboration capabilities beyond websites. Now, you can collaborate on a wide variety of files including images, videos, and lottie animations. Collaboration on files supports all of our existing real-time and async collaboration features, such as adding comments, voice notes, screen recordings, group huddles, and all the other features you are used to. If you an agency that manages websites along with the creation of other types of creative assets, Superflow has you covered!
