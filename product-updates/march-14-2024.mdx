# Superflow Product Updates - March 14, 2024

We're excited to announce the latest updates to Superflow! Here's what's new in this release:


## 1-page Installation

We've simplified the Superflow website installation process for those of you who are experienced with installing code snippets. Now, the installation page will autodetect when a snippet is added and finalize the installation all on the same page.

If you aren't a code snippet installation expert and still need an in-depth walkthrough of each of the installation steps, those options are still available.

## Private Comments

If you want to leave comments that only your team can see, you can use Private Comments.

This is useful if you want to leave comments that you don't want your clients or guests to see.

You can also convert a normal comment to a Private Comment and vice-versa.
