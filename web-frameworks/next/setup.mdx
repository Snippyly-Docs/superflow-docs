## 3) Install the Superflow NPM package

```

## 4) Import Superflow into your `page.tsx` file

```
import { initSuperflow } from '@usesuperflow/client'
```


## 5) Initialize Superflow within `page.tsx`

Import `initSuperflow` from the NPM package and use it to initialize Superflow.

Create a `useEffect` hook and paste in the unique Superflow code you copied earlier.

Be sure to add `"use client"` at the top of your `page.tsx` file to enable client side data-fetching.

```js
"use client";

import Image from 'next/image'
import { useEffect } from 'react'
import { initSuperflow } from '@usesuperflow/client'

export default function Home() {

useEffect(()=>{
  initSuperflow('jweIj5yb3k6WElsyHyp3', {
    projectId: '7562859393923502'
  });

})
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      Test out Superflow by hightlighting this text.
    </main>
  )
}

## 8) Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting your verifying your installation? Here are the common mistakes users encounter when installing Superflow:

 - Did you forget to save the Custom Code?
 - Did you forget to publish your site?
 - Is the browser still loading a cached version?
 - Did you add `?review=true` at the end of your url?
 - Did you publish your changes on a staging URL while you are trying to access a Prod URL?
 - Did you accidentally install multiple Superflow scripts in the Custom Code?


## 9) Navigate to your Next site 

Open you have verified that Superflow has been installed on your Next site, navigate to your published site and add `?review=true` at the end of the URL to enable Superflow. 

`Example: mywebsite.com/?review=true`
