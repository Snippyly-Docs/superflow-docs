## 4) Install the Superflow NPM package

Install the Superflow NPM package with:

```
npm i @usesuperflow/client
```

## 5) Import Superflow into your `App.js` file

Import the Superflow NPM package with:

```
import { initSuperflow } from '@usesuperflow/client'
```

## 6) Initialize Superflow within `App.js`

Import `initSuperflow` from the NPM package and use it to initialize Superflow.

Create a `useEffect` hook and paste in the unique Superflow code you copied earlier.


```js
import './App.css';
import logo from './logo.svg';

import { initSuperflow } from '@usesuperflow/client';
import { useEffect } from 'react';


function App() {

  useEffect( () => {
    //initialize Superflow
    initSuperflow('YOUR_API_KEY', {
      projectId: 'YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
    });
  })
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <p>Test out Superflow by highlighting this text.</p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

## 9) Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting your verifying your installation? Here are the common mistakes users encounter when installing Superflow:

 - Did you forget to save the Custom Code?
 - Did you forget to publish your site?
 - Is the browser still loading a cached version?
 - Did you add `?review=true` at the end of your url?
 - Did you publish your changes on a staging URL while you are trying to access a Prod URL?
 - Did you accidentally install multiple Superflow scripts in the Custom Code?


## 10) Navigate to your React site 

Now that you have verified that Superflow has been installed on your React site, navigate to your published site and add `?review=true` at the end of the URL to enable Superflow. 

`Example: mywebsite.com/?review=true`


## 11) Test out Superflow

You should now see a Superflow toolbar on the bottom right of your screen.
