import './assets/main.css'

import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'
import { initSuperflow } from '@usesuperflow/client'

const app = createApp(App)

//initialize Superflow
initSuperflow('jweIj5yb3k6WElsyHyp3', {
    projectId: '7562859393923502'
});

app.use(router)

app.mount('#app')

```

## 7) Troubleshooting

Having trouble getting your verifying your installation? Here are the common mistakes users encounter when installing Superflow:

 - Did you forget to save the Custom Code?
 - Did you forget to publish your site?
 - Is the browser still loading a cached version?
 - Did you add `?review=true` at the end of your url?
 - Did you publish your changes on a staging URL while you are trying to access a Prod URL?
 - Did you accidentally install multiple Superflow scripts in the Custom Code?


## 8) Navigate to your Vue site 

Open you have verified that Superflow has been installed on your Vue site, navigate to your published site and add `?review=true` at the end of the URL to enable Superflow. 

`Example: mywebsite.com/?review=true`
